        <h2><i>"Here are some of our happiest memories from this year, though just a few of the countless moments we've shared. 
            I can't even begin to imagine what a year it's been, full of both joy and tears. 
            But the most important thing is that we are still together, still here, and forever. 
            Be with me always, so we can continue to create more beautiful memories together. 
            Thank you for every second you've been by my side. I am forever grateful for you."</i></h2>
