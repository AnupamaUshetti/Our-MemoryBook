        <h1>Lovable Moments</h1>
        <h2><i>"Here are just a few of our most memorable moments from this year, though there are so many more to cherish.
            I may not have a lot of money to give you all the luxuries, but I know that the love and effort I put into everything we share brings you happiness. 
            I'm trying my very best, and I promise to keep doing so. Our journey is far from over; we have so many more years ahead and countless beautiful moments yet to come. 
            I may not be the perfect boyfriend, but I will be the best husband in the world, and not just any husband! but your loving, devoted husband."</i></h2>
